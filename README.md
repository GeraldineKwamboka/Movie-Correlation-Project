# Movie Correlation Project

## Introduction
This Python project explores movie correlations, inspired by the analysis performed by Alex The Analyst on YouTube. The project focuses on understanding the relationships between various factors that contribute to a movie's success or popularity.

## Project Overview
In this project, we delve into the following key aspects:

- Data Collection: Gathering movie-related data from publicly available sources.
- Data Cleaning: Preparing the dataset by handling missing values and ensuring data consistency.
- Data Exploration: Exploring the dataset to identify interesting patterns and trends.
- Correlation Analysis: Calculating correlations between different movie attributes to uncover relationships.
- Data Visualization: Creating visualizations to present our findings effectively.
